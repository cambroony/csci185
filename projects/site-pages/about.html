                    A native of Asheville, John C. Frue (known as Jack to his friends) and his wife, Terri, were married at Grace Episcopal Church in 2003.
                    Their twins Bailey and Cameron were baptized at Grace in 2005.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
                    Jack grew up within the congregation of St. Mary’s Episcopal Church on Charlotte Street and served as an acolyte beginning at age nine. He has served on the vestry at Grace and currently participates in several ministries at the parish including Men of the Church, Room in the Inn mobile shelter for homeless women, the prison ministry offering Christian fellowship to the incarcerated, the backpackers program providing food to families in need, and regularly serves as a chalicist at the early service.

                <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
                    Jack holds a bachelor of arts degree in Economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a law degree from Mercer University. He volunteers as an attorney for Pisgah Legal Services offering assistance, advocacy and outreach to help low-income people meet basic legal needs.

                <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
                    When he isn't engaged in practicing law, his interests include trout fishing, camping, gardening, cooking, and the North Carolina Tar Heels. Jack and Terri’s favorite activity is watching Cameron and Bailey grow.
